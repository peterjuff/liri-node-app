# liri-node-app
LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.
LIRI will respond to the following commands:
* `my-tweets`

* `spotify-this-song`

* `movie-this`

* `do-what-it-says`
